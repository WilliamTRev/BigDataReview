#### Download + install Hive
- cd to your home directory
- ```wget https://mirrors.sonic.net/apache/hive/hive-3.1.2/apache-hive-3.1.2-bin.tar.gz```
- wait for this complete
- ```tar -xvzf apache-hive-3.1.2-bin.tar.gz```

#### Add exports to .bashrc
- ```sudo nano .bashrc```
- Add the lines below to the .bashrc that opens, replacing username with your username
- ```export HADOOP_HOME=~/hadoop/hadoop-3.3.3```
- ```export HIVE_HOME=~/apache-hive-3.1.2-bin```
- ```export PATH=$HADOOP_HOME/bin:$HIVE_HOME/bin:$PATH```

- ```#Additional shortcuts, from Danny:```
- ```alias startdfs='$HADOOP_HOME/sbin/start-dfs.sh'```
- ```alias startyarn='$HADOOP_HOME/sbin/start-yarn.sh'```
- ```alias stopdfs='$HADOOP_HOME/sbin/stop-dfs.sh'```
- ```alias stopyarn='$HADOOP_HOME/sbin/stop-yarn.sh'```
- Close and restart your Ubuntu shell.(source ~/.bashrc)

#### Run HDFS commands necessary for Hive setup
- start hdfs + yarn if not already running (you can check with ```jps```)
- ```startdfs``` (makes use of the alias above)
- ```startyarn```
- ```hadoop fs -mkdir /tmp```
- ```hadoop fs -mkdir -p /user/hive/warehouse```
- ```hadoop fs -chmod g+w /tmp```
- ```hadoop fs -chmod g+w /user```
- ```hadoop fs -chmod g+w /user/hive```
- ```hadoop fs -chmod g+w /user/hive/warehouse```

#### Initialize Hive
- ```schematool -dbType derby -initSchema```
- This should say 'schemaTool completed' at the end.  It will create a derby.log file and
- a metastore_db directory in our $HIVE_HOME.  If you ever need to destructive restart hive, delete those files and run this command again.

- We can now connect on the command line using: ```beeline -u jdbc:hive2://```
- Use Ctrl+D to exit beeline

NOTE: setting up the beeline with a new install can be tricky, you can also just use $HIVE_HOME/bin/hive to access the hive without using the beeline. We like the beeline because it is a an enhanced CLI which supports multi-client concurrency with HiveServer2, but as long you know this you, your practice is equivalent with either beeline or the regular hive CLI. 

- run a create database command to make sure it's working:
- ```CREATE DATABASE testdb;```


#### Final notes
- Hive runs using Hadoop, so you'll need to have HDFS + YARN running.
- You'll also need to remember to start the ssh daemon (sshd) when you boot up Ubuntu after a restart


-for beeline use:
sudo nohup $HIVE_HOME/bin/hiveserver2&
beeline -u jdbc:hive2://
